                    I enjoy learning new knowledge and use them in my programs.

                    Since then, I loved producing new things by myself. When I learned about programming
                    at first time, I was truly attracted by it and I believe that I'm able to produce
                    couple of programs in the future.

                        <br/><br/>
                        This software ought to have functions followed:<br/><br/>
                        1: Users sign in this software and full in their location and community.<br/><br/>
                        2: proprietors can apply to sell their idle items on this software and describe it by words and pictures.<br/><br/>

                        •Motivation1: Many proprietors are crazy about flea market in community to sell or purchase some idle items but they have little time 
                        to join offline transaction.Mark Ferguson(2018) states that More evidence
                         of Australia's love of online shopping has emerged tonight. According to new data, 4 million people used Amazon Australia last month,
                          up 81 percent from the previous month's figure.Therefore, online flea market is likely to be reasonable idea.
                        <br/><br/>
                        •Motivation2: Denis Metev(2021) states that there are 5.11 billion people using mobile phone(2019)
                        , and half of them are using smartphone.
                        Moreover,there are 100 million new smart phone users each  year and most of them
                        are internet users.Therefore, Moblie internet applications is a huge market and rather than 
                        software and website in computer , the cost of software development is lower.In other words, it is likely to be a more attractive
                        software if it is a mobile applications.
                        <br/><br/>
                        •Motivation3: Large online shopping company like amazons can't deliver items in a short time.Rather than it, property management company
                        can take items deliver them in one day.
                        <br/><br/>
                        •Motivation4: property management company can obtain data of proprietors by community survey online or other ways.Therefore,
                        it is a large advantages fot property management company to develop a smartphone application for their proprietors.

                        This smartphone application can be developed as an independent software by JAVA or PYTHON or it can be a website and little software in
                        large platform like wechat so that I have to use CSS/JS/PHP to develop it.<br/><br/>
                        the process of this project:<br/><br/>
                        1. User registration: Proprietor have to register as a new user and fill in some personal information including gender/community/location/way of contact.<br/><br/>
                        2. post information of goods: Sellers have to upload three or more pictures of their items with least 15 words to describe using experience of 
                        goods and selling reasons.After that, sellers have to select type of their goods like female clothes or daily supplies so that others can search
                        this item esier.At last, sellers have to select whether it is a brand new item or used one and give a reasonable price of it.<br/><br/>
                        3.popularize goods: Software will popularize this item to proprietors in same community.<br/><br/>
                        4.purchaser ask detail: Proprietors who are interested in this item can post questions in item page so that other users who have same questions
                        can see it.Sellers will reply those question one by one.<br/><br/>
                        5.purchase the item: purchaser buy the item by paypal or online banking service and software will inform seller to prepare delivery.<br/><br/>
                        6.property management company will contact the seller by calling or e-mail and discuss the time to take the item.<br/><br/>
                        7.staff of property management company will take the item and deliver it to purchaser and get reward from him/her.<br/><br/>
                        8.make comment of the item: purchaser can make comment of this item on comment page which can be watched by other proprietors<br/><br/>
                        9.statistical analysis reputaion: there is a reputation system in software, which means if one sellers receive many negative reputation,
                        software will forbid this seller to sell other items.<br/><br/>
                        10.make comment of property management company: if purchaser dissatisfied with delivery or software,he/she can make comment on it and
